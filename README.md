# Project Name

This project is built using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript with Babel. It utilizes Laravel Mix for the build process and asset compilation.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

### Development

To start the development server and compile the assets in real-time, run the following command:

npm run dev

This command runs Laravel Mix and starts the development server. Any changes made to the source files will be automatically compiled.

npm run build

This command cleans the `dist` directory, compiles the assets with optimizations, and prepares the project for deployment.
